# BassTabMakerFrontend2

App to create bass guitar tablature. Second repo, meaning I created a v1, then started again from scratch.

Uses ReactQuery, with the state pk for songs as the key. This way, whenever you select another song, useQuery is called automatically.

Will likely create another branch and begin a large refactor, because feature creep has caused complecity to grow.
