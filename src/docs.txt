# utils.tsx

- 'songState' behaves as both the state we render from, as well as a 'cache', allowing the user
   to swap around different songs and persists the unsaved song edit changes. This works because of
   the useEffect in MeasureView. The useEffect first checks for a cached song, instead of using the query
   from the backend.

- 'useRefreshSong': Manually clears the song from 'songState' and fetches the song from the backend,
   and then resets 'songState'. This was needed so that we can bypass the caching mechanism from MeasureView.useEffect.
